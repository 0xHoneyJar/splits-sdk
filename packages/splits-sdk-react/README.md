This is the react wrapper for the core splits sdk. It provides convenient hooks for easily 
displaying 0xSplits data in a React app. The core sdk client is also available for performing 
all contract transactions.

## Install

### Install the package with yarn or npm:

```bash
yarn add @0xsplits/splits-sdk-react
